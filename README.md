# UPenn-CS-Bootcamp-Final
This group project is the culmination of the Upenn cyber security bootcamp.  Our instructor asked us to analyze the given network and determine the vulnerabilities on the network hosts.  We then used the vulnerabilities to gain access to each host and find hidden flags.  Afterward, we used a SIEM to analyze our previous intrusion attempts to understand what unauthorized user activities might look like.  From the SIEM data, we provided remediation steps to slow or halt these activities for the given vulnerabilities.  (Configured Kibana alerts, identified exposed ports with Nmap, enumerated site with WordPress scan and Nikto, opened a reverse shell with Ncat listener, conducted network forensic analysis with Wireshark.)
